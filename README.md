# WorkAround-Explorer


### Description:
A website designed to practice JavaScript ES6 modules.

### Technologies and credits:
Most of this was done by codecademy.  I just added the imports and exports and fixed guided instructions to some parts of the files.  I did do the bonus section.  The bonus was to create a utilites file and create a function to format numbers with commas.  I found a 2 line code built in javascript to format the numbers and include the cents when necessary specifically for US currency from Stack Overflow.  I was tempted to write this code from scratch, for practice, but I know in the real world, time is money.  I'm sure the company I would be working for or if I was freelancing myself, that the prefered method is to utilize what's already written in the code world, find and use it to save time for everyone!  Not to mention it's less code!
